There’s no such thing as a dumb question but there is a dumb way to ask questions, and yes, there’s a difference. There is no shame in asking someone with more experience with software engineering; they are a great source, afterall. Yet, to get a satisfactory answer you have to ask the right way. I don’t mean you have to ask in a kind manner, I mean you have to ask in a smart manner. Otherwise, some of your peers may not take you seriously and may ignore your question all together, and you can’t learn if no one is there to teach. Asking smart questions helps you learn and grow as a software engineer; asking a smart question means you’ve done the research and are acutally putting in the effort. Not just expecting others to do the work for you.

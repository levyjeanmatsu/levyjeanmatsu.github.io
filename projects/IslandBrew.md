summary: My first job as a barista!
---

  My very first job was at a coffee shop up the street from the University of Hawaii at Manoa.
At Island Brew Cofeehouse Kaimuki, we serve food items such as sandwiches, waffles, and acai bowls, as well as coffee. As a worker 
who dealt with customers, I had to be able to display a positive attitude as well as manage to do my work load. 
  At Island Brew Cofeehouse, I developed better time management and communication. Furthermore, I experienced a high-paced 
 environment and learned how to do tasks in an organized manner. Working in the food industry also helped me become more aware
 of my actions since our customers could have food allergies or could get sick from consuming food. I also became better at 
 multi-tasking since I often encountered multiple orders at once.
